                    Graphs are a way to organize data on a computer. The simplest form of a graph in our daily lives is a recipe which calls for a specific number of ingredients to be added to the mixing bowl in a very specific order in order for the recipe to come out right. Another example of a graph that we see every single time we open our computers is the file management system in our computers. It is simple to see how a file management system is represented by a graph because you cant go to a file that is nested within folders without first going to those folders in order to get to the file, otherwise known as a list of dependencies. Graphs are also useful in services such as the internet, because when you have search engines such as Google, it is a lot simpler to use a graph to represent webpages rather than running through a list of every known website on the internet. Graphs can stored in computers in 2 different ways each of which has its advantages and its disadvantages. These two ways are through forms called adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
